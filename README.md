<h1>Line level Security</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will show steps to secure a Cisco device at the line level.<br/>
Configurations are done on a Router, but the same commands can be used on Switch.

<h4> Securing VTY line:</h4> 
Securing Virtual Terminal (VTY) lines, also known as remote management lines, is crucial for maintaining the security of network devices, particularly in the context of remote administration.

<h4> Exec Timeout:</h4> 
Configuring an exec timeout is essential for managing the security and resources of networking devices, such as routers and switches. The exec timeout feature determines how long a user session remains active before it automatically terminates due to inactivity. <br/>

<h4> Priviledge Exec Password:</h4> 
Configuring a privileged EXEC password is essential for ensuring the security and integrity of networking devices, such as routers and switches. The privileged EXEC password, also known as the enable password, controls access to privileged EXEC mode, which allows users to make configuration changes and access sensitive system settings. <br/>
